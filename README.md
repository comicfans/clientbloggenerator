Create static blog pages for server, but dynamic from client


During working with github pages, I'm trying to use jekyll, and this is the beginning of my nightmare. 

After running bunch of gem commands followed by the guild(I haven't used ruby before), I got a "jekyll-paginate" (or what ever) not found error. Google told me I should install jekyll-paginate â€¦ Shouldn't gem install or bundle takes care dependencies already ? Or what's the meaning of previously running commands ? After installing jekyll-paginate , I got a "Liquid Warning: Liquid syntax error (line 61): Unexpected character & in "site.duoshuo_share && site.duoshuo_username" in /_layouts/post.html" . And someone points this is a jekyll compatible issue. my jekyll shows version 3.5, but github pages 

Why jekyll still create html for already static pages?
